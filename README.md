# Structural-Analysis-with-Graph-Neural-Networks

In this paper, a rapid surrogate is developed for structural analysis using graph neural networks. A novel and compact graph representation conforming to the structural connectivities is proposed. Graph neural networks (GNN) and message-passing mechanisms are utilized to handle the interactions between stories and structural elements. A structural graph neural network (StructGNN) framework is developed, which contains a dynamic number of message-passing layers. The rigid slab constraint is embodied within the message-passing layers, making message propagation more efficient and realistic. After training with random-shaped structures and random-valued lateral forces, the StructGNN model accurately predicts the distribution of forces and deformations and exhibits high generalizability to taller, unseen structures. With high interpretability in its message-passing mechanism and high-speed computation with GPU parallelism, StructGNN is a fast alternative to traditional structural analysis. It has a high potential to solve more complex structural engineering problems.
